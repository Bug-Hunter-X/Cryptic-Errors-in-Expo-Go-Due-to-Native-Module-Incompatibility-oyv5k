This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test a React Native application that uses a library that requires native modules.  The error message may not be very clear, but the cause is the same: the native modules are not available in the Expo Go environment.  For instance, using a library that requires access to the device's camera may produce unexpected behaviors or this cryptic error.
