# Cryptic Errors in Expo Go Due to Native Module Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo Go to test React Native applications that rely on native modules.  The problem arises because Expo Go's isolated environment doesn't always support native module functionalities, leading to ambiguous errors.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases a React Native component attempting to utilize a hypothetical native module (`CameraModule`) for accessing the device's camera.  When running this in Expo Go, you might encounter vague error messages or unexpected behavior rather than a clear indication of the native module incompatibility.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a solution: using Expo's `expo-camera` library.  This library is designed to be Expo compatible, making it possible to access the camera without directly interacting with native modules.

To use this solution, replace the native module import and usage in `bug.js` with the code provided in `bugSolution.js`.
